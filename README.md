## Technology Used
- React
- JSX
- Redux
- BootStrap
- Semantic UI

## Major Hurdles

- The use of redux to create a login & logout functionality.

- I assumed results of specific functionality without testing it myself. This caused me to waste time with guessing. 

## Stretch Goals
- Create back end and save list to individual users
- Allow users to grant permission to others to edit their list
- Add icons in the directions in the about page.
- Add carousel to homepage
- Add a description of each ride
